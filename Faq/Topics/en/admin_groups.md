#Admin Groups
Admin groups is a plugin that will intercept all admin commands in order
to check if a user has required privileges to use that command. The plug-in
will also allow you to manage all your admins and their permissions easily.
You don't need to modify complicated config files or commands you
just use it like you would use any other desktop application.

To be able to use this you first need to be admin yourself, the easiest way to
do this is to add yourself to the admin list of `manialive` itself.
Just add this line in the config:

```
    manialive.admins[] = 'your login'
```

Once an admin just start manialive and join your server. You may access the admin
groups window with `right click` anywhere on the screen -> `Server Main` in the
menu then click `Admin Groups` or use the following command: `/admin groups`


At the Admin Groups page you can see a list of different Admin Groups.
`Master Admin` group can't be deleted, it is the group that has all the permissions,
and the group where all ManiaLive admins are automatically added.


## Adding Admins
Just click on `Players` on the `Admin Groups` of the group into which you want to add
a player. A new page with the player list will appear. Write the login of the user on the input
box on top and click `Add`.

You have added an Admin to that group. It should appear in the list below. If the player
is connected to the server you might also just click on select and select him in the new
window that opens.

## Adding Groups
On `Admin Groups` just fill up the input box on top with the name of the group and then
click on `Add`.

You have created a new group.
`Notice!` New groups has no permissions by default.

## Inheriting permissions
Let's know say you want to create a new group `VIP Members` to whom you want to give
the same permissions as a `Operator`. You may redefine the permissions manually of use
the inheritance. On the `Admin Groups page` click on `Inheritance `of the `VIP Members`
group you have created. It will open a new window. On this window just search for the
`Operator` group and check the checkbox.

You can now close the window it is done, the group will inherit the permissions
of the other group.

## Changing permissions
After a while you have observed that the `VIP Members` abuses their right to mute people;
you would like to remove this permission from them. On the `Admin Groups page` click on
permissions of `VIP Members`. Search for the player mute permission.

First remove the check on the `inherit` checkbox then be sure the `permission` checkbox
is unchecked. You are done. All other permissions will still be inherited by Operator group
but not the player mute permission.

# Configuration options

`config\<serverlogin>_admins.ini`
