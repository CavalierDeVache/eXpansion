#Widgets: how to show/hide individual widgets ?
You can easily show or hide nearly any of the widgets you seen at screen hud.

1. First open the menu.
    * Simply right click anywhere on the screen. 
    * A menu should popup.
2. select Hud > Config...
3. on the window appearing, untick the checkbox to hide that widget.
4. and tick the check box to show the widget again.

If you can't access menu, or you have disabled other settings and wish to revert the widgets back
to original state, you can reset the hud by typing `/hud reset`
