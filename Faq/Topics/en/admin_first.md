# First steps after installation
Here is a few useful tips to make server administration easier for you.

As currently there is no way to fetch infos on dedicated server files using
dedicated API, the files needs to be configured manually in order to
auto-save the changed values for next server restart.

* Open admin settings window 
    * Type `/adm settings` in chat and enter
    * click tab `Config files`

* fill in your 
    * `match settings` file 
    * `dedicated_cfg.txt` file
    * `server settings`-file.

the `Server setting`-files are very powerful, as all expansion settings are
saved & loaded from them, this means also active plugins. There is already
defined some for, like match or minimal configs for plugins. If you are running 
a single expansion you don't need to set up this. If you are running form a single 
install multiple expansions & wish to have different configurations on these you need
to set it up.
