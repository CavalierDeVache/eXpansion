#Managing maps at server
Fast way to add/remove current map from current playlist is to use chat command:
`/adm remove this` or if you have queued a map from mx, you can add current map 
permanently to the server `/adm add this`!

You can browse, add map to current maplist or delete a map from disk:
`Menu` > `Maps` > `Add local maps`

Maps can be removed from the current playlist from maps list
`Menu` > `Maps` > `Show Maps`

##Autosaving mapslist
Controller will do autosave of the maps list according to your default mapslist.
see `/adm settings` > `Config Files` for defaults and changing them.

You can have multiple map lists easily at your server, see following topic to manage your 
matchsettings.
